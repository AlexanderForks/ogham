/**
 * <p>
 * Decorator resolver that is able to manage lookup prefix. It associates each
 * prefix to a dedicated resolver.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The lookup is a prefix that contains at least one ':' character. The lookup
 * prefix is case sensitive. For example, if the path is
 * <code>"classpath:/foo/bar.txt"</code> then the lookup prefix is
 * <code>"classpath:"</code>. If the path is <code>"foo:bar:/foobar.txt"</code>
 * then the lookup prefix is <code>"foo:bar:"</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The lookup can also be empty in order to define a kind of default resolver if
 * no lookup is provided. The resource path could then be "/email/hello.html".
 * The resolver associated to empty string lookup will be used in this case.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This resolver is a conditional resolver. The resource path is supported only
 * if there exists a resolver for the provided lookup. Moreover, if the resolver
 * associated to the lookup is also a conditional resolver, the resource path
 * resolution is possible only if the dedicated resolver also indicates that the
 * resource path can be handled.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the resource resolution starts, this implementation just delegates to
 * the resolver dedicated to the provided lookup.
 * </p>
