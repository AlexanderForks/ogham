/**
 * <p>
 * Assists in implementing Object.hashCode() methods.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class enables a good hashCode method to be built for any class. It
 * follows the rules laid out in the book Effective Java by Joshua Bloch.
 * Writing a good hashCode method is actually quite difficult. This class aims
 * to simplify the process.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following is the approach taken. When appending a data field, the current
 * total is multiplied by the multiplier then a relevant value for that data
 * type is added. For example, if the current hashCode is 17, and the multiplier
 * is 37, then appending the integer 45 will create a hashcode of 674, namely 17
 * * 37 + 45.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * All relevant fields from the object should be included in the hashCode
 * method. Derived fields may be excluded. In general, any field used in the
 * equals method must be used in the hashCode method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To use this class write code as follows:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  public class Person {
 *    String name;
 *    int age;
 *    boolean smoker;
 *    ...
 * 
 *    public int hashCode() {
 *      // you pick a hard-coded, randomly chosen, non-zero, odd number
 *      // ideally different for each class
 *      return new HashCodeBuilder(17, 37).
 *        append(name).
 *        append(age).
 *        append(smoker).
 *        hashCode();
 *    }
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If required, the superclass hashCode() can be added using appendSuper.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, there is a method that uses reflection to determine the fields
 * to test. Because these fields are usually private, the method,
 * reflectionHashCode, uses AccessibleObject.setAccessible to change the
 * visibility of the fields. This will fail under a security manager, unless the
 * appropriate permissions are set up correctly. It is also slower than testing
 * explicitly.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A typical invocation for this method would look like:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public int hashCode() {
 * 	return HashCodeBuilder.reflectionHashCode(this);
 * }
 * </pre>
